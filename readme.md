# Online order Form for local Restaurant

An online order form for my fave local restaurant I built to support a recent marketing campaign they were running. 

# What I Learned
* Developed a user interface with the restaurant's menu laid out for customers to select items they wish to order ( no payments involved)
* Implemented functinality to the UI: form validation.
* Integrated an async call to the back end to process the order and show a spinner untill the backend returns a success or erro message.
* Backend Implemented funtionality using PHP: recieve and parse the json data, create html email for customer, and restaurant admin, send the email.
